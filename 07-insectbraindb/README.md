# Insect neurons from insectbraindb.org

## Article

The [insectbraindb.org](https://insectbraindb.org/app/) is an online database that hosts neuroanatomy data for (at the time of writing, May 2019) 12 species of insect, including template brains and a total of ~130 neurons. Not all of its data is public, but that which is can be read using the R package *neuromorphr* into objects that can bew used with *nat* ecosystem tools.

In this example, we mostly use neurons from the Monarch butterfly, which were obtaine by the Reppert laboratory and presented in these two publications:

The [insectbraindb.org](https://insectbraindb.org/app/) is primarily curated by [Dr. Stanley Heinze](https://www.biology.lu.se/stanley-heinze), and was buily by [Kevin Tedore](https://tedore.com/), and has several significant [supporters](https://insectbraindb.org/app/), including the ERC. Please ensure that you contact [Stanley Heinze](http://biology.lu.se/stanley-heinze) in order to verify an appropriate citation before using any of this data!
