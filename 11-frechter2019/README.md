# Processing *Drosophila* neurons from Flycircuit, as curated by Frechter et al.

## Article

The traced neurons in this example were automatically reconstructed from single segmented images of genetically labelled Drosophila neurons as described by:

They were subsequently collected, cell typed and further analysed in:
